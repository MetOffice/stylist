Welcome to the "Stylist" code style checking tool.

The goal of this tool is to provide a flexible way of checking source code
against a set of rules. Rather than require that you adopt a particular set of
rules it aims to offer you the chance to build up the style you like.

This tool was crerated to fulfil a need for such a tool to target Fortran
source code. As such Fortran is currently the only language supported but there
is no reason it wouldn't work for others.
