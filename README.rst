Stylist Documentation Repository
================================

This repository holds the documentation which is available on the web at https://metoffice.github.io/stylist.

Most of these files are automatically generated and and modifications will be overwritten when it is next updated.

In particular the directories "latest" and "v*" are API documentation generated by Sphinx.

On the other hand "index.html" is hand made and provides links into the documentation.

This file is README.rst and is also hand made for GitHub users.
